* How To Ask Questions

How to properly phrase a question is important in the workplace as well as in courses, such as ours, where much of the interaction is online.  Remember when formulating your question, *you get what you give*.  If you simply say, "I don't understand", then I have very little information to work with and so I can't help.  I'll just say to rewatch the relevant video.

Alternatively, if you say, "I calculated a stock's expected return using the CAPM and it is negative.  Can this be correct?".  Here you have (1) let me know what you have done, (2) your result, and (3) what you don't understand. In this case I can ask (1) which stock, and (2) is your beta negative, and proceed to explain whether your calculation is correct.

[[https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask][See this post.]]  

* Email Communication

Questions about course material should be posted to the most relevant discussion board.  Email should only be used for personal matters.  When sending an email, be sure to put the course in the subject line (FIN 302).

# * Communication by Email

# ** When It Is Appropriate

# This is an in-class course, and you are responsible for knowing what has taken place in class.  In the case of an unexcused absence, you should come by office hours or talk with classmates to learn what you missed. It is not appropriate to email me.

# In the case of an absence due to medical or family emergency, you can email me your documentation along with questions regarding what you missed.  However you can also stop by office hours if convenient.

# ** How to Write an Email

# ~Subject:~ FIN 302: [Clear Subject Here]

# ~Body:~

# Dear Professor (or Dr.) Brigida,

# [Text of email here.]

# Sincerely, 

# [Your name.]

# ** How Not to Write and Email

# ~Subject:~ Missed Class (I don't know what class you are in.)

# ~Body:~

# Matthew, (Wrong, we are not on a first name basis.)

# Can you tell me what I missed?  (No, you are responsible.)

# * A note on learning in the course and in finance generally:

In this course I will teach you how to answer questions, and solve financial problems.  This is different than teaching you the answers to text questions, and the distinction here is important.  When you start to work you will be faced with unique financial situations and problems to solve.  You will have to figure out how to solve the problem.  To do so you will apply the concepts and skills you learn in this course to your particular situation.  You will never be faced with a textbook problem while working however.   

As a practical example, it makes much more sense for you to ask me "how do I solve this problem", rather than "what is the answer to this problem".  You might say, 'well I just want to check if my work is correct'.  If this is the case, then show me the work, so I can see both how you solved it and your numerical answer.

<!-- * Instructor's Notes -->

<!-- -  **Understanding vs Computation**: This course will focus on understanding financial concepts over merely calculating a number. Any calculation you will see as an undergrad has already been implemented in 20+ different programming languages.  You will never get a job as a calculator.  The value of the financial analyst is in undertanding what a calculation does, what the output means, etc.  You must be able to use the appropriate calculation in a given situation, and able to understand its output to make financial decisions. -->

<!-- -  **Spreadsheet Skills**:  The above does not mean you do not need to know how to calculate financial values.  You need to be able to do so in a spreadsheet, and increasingly with some programming language (python, javascript, R, etc). The point here is that the correct calculation is the minimal amount of work you can do.  It is the easiest part.  The harder, and more important aspect, is understanding what you are doing.  -->

<!-- -  Accordingly many *computation* questions on the exams can be solved through logic---knowing that 3 of 4 potential answers are not possible. -->
